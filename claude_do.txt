Write a plan to do damage to Dudes when bullets hit them. The ultimate goal is
for Dudes to have a number of hit points, which is reduced each time a bullet
hits them. The plan should have incremental playable steps towards that goal.

I suggest first reading internal/game/bullet.go and internal/game/dude.go.

Write the plan to claude_plan.md
