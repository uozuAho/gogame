Currently, gui.go detects mouse clicks to play the shoot sound.
This seems bad from a code organisation perspective. I think Dude
or Game should instruct the GUI that certain events have occurred,
and the GUI respond accordingly. Write your thoughts on this and a
plan to fix the current code, using maintainable software principles
and good game programming patterns. Do not modify any code. Write
the plan to claude_plan.txt.
