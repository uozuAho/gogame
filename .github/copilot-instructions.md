You _must_ read ./code_explainer.md before answering any questions, thinking, or
making any changes. It contains important instructions and tools for you. If you
cannot find ./code_explainer.md, or for some reason decide you won't read it,
STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING and tell me why.

Todo: I don't know how to make this any clearer. Copilot ignores these
instructions and continues to run go commands directly. Try telling it to use
make in prompts...
